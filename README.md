### About Me

I picked up programming as a hobby around 4 years ago with the intent of eventually building out a career. I have been formally taking community college courses for about the past two years, however I am would say I am mostly self-taught using documentation and sites like Coursera, Udemy, and Codecademy. Language proficiencies including:

- Python
- Javascript
- Java
- SQL
- HTML/CSS

In addition to the proficiencies above, I have a year of schooling in Geographic Information Systems where I refined my Python skills as they pertain to map building and spatial analysis. I then decided to focus more on the programming aspect so I shifted to obtaining some programming certificates at the same school. In spite of my outstanding academic performance in both the GIS and programming curriculums, I chose to leave school to further refine my skills and build a portfolio at a pace more suitable for my needs.
